## Product Overview for February 29th, 2024

### Overall Product Description
The Art Generator Project is a user-driven, web-based art generation product that provides its user with modified images and videos using real-time data centered around social causes. Users can provide input of live camera input or generic stock photos, which will be modified depending upon data relating to climate change including rising temperatures, ice melting, deforestation, rising sea levels, and wildlife exctinctions. Users will be able to share their new art creations by file download or through social media. This project places an emphasis on security and privacy for user data that is used in the application.
